   ```
2. Install FrontEnd dependencies:

3. Add Firebase configuration:
   **Create a firebase.js file in FrontEnd/src/ folder with your Firebase credentials:**
   ```javascript
    import {initializeApp} from 'firebase/app'
    import { getFirestore, connectFirestoreEmulator} from 'firebase/firestore'
    import { getAuth, connectAuthEmulator } from 'firebase/auth'

    // const firebaseConfig = {
    //    apiKey: <Your-API-Key>,
    //    authDomain: <Your-Auth-Domain>,
    //    projectId: <Your-Project-ID>,
    //    storageBucket: <Your-Storage-Bucket>,
    //    messagingSenderId: <Your-Messaging-Sender-ID>,
    //    appId: <Your-App-ID>,
    //    measurementId: <Your-Measurement-ID>"
    // }

    const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig)
    const db = getFirestore(app)
    const auth = getAuth(app)

    if( process.env.NODE_ENV === "emu" ){
        connectFirestoreEmulator(db,"localhost","8080")
        connectAuthEmulator(auth,"localhost","9099" )
    }

    export { db, auth }
   ```
4. Install and set up the backend
    ```bash
    cd BackEnd
    npm init
    npm install express
    ```
5. Install firebase (hosting, auth, firestore ) in front end

6. install firebase Admin (hosting, firestore, admin, auth) in backend

7. Include firebase admin config file firebase-admin.js in BackEnd
   with your own credential JSON file.

   ```javascript
    const admin = require('firebase-admin')

    const serviceAccount = require('path/to/your/own/admin-credential/json-file')

    admin.initializeApp(
        {
            credential : admin.credential.cert(serviceAccount),
        }
    )

    const db = admin.firestore()
    const auth = admin.auth()
    // console.log(auth);

    module.exports = { db, auth, admin }
   ```

8. start backend with command (w.r.t root folder)
